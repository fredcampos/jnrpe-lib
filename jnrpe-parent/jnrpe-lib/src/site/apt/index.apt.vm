JNRPE Library
 
   The JNRPE library is the heart of the whole JNRPE package.
   It allows to embed inside your application the JNRPE so that you will be able to answer to
   check_nrpe queries.
   
   If you need an example, feel free to use the sources of the JNRPE Server: it is built on top
   of this library.
   
* Compiling against jnrpe-lib

  The easiest way to compile an application using jnrpe-lib is through the use
  of {{{http://maven.apache.org/}maven}}.
  
  If you don't want to use maven, you have to manually download the dependencies.

** Compiling using maven

  Create the following directory structure:
  
+--------------+

  +- src/
       +- main/
           +- java/
  +- pom.xml
+--------------+     
  
  and put your sources under the 'java' directory.
  
  Create a file called pom.xml in the same directory as 'src'. 
  This are the jnrpe-lib data:
  
  * group-id : net.sf.jnrpe
  * artifact-id : jnrpe-lib
  
  Edit the pom.xml file according to the {{{http://maven.apache.org}maven documentation}} and insert the following 
  dependency:
  
+--------------+

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sf.jnrpe</groupId>
    <artifactId>jnrpe-lib</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>

+--------------+
  
  as soon as your project is complete, you can run: 
  
+------------+

  mvn compile package

+------------+  

** Custom compiling

  If you don't use maven, than you are on your own and you will have to manually download jnrpe-lib and all its dependecies 
  manually.
  
  You can download jnrpe-lib  and its dependencies (deps.tar.gz) {{{https://sourceforge.net/projects/jnrpe/files/jnrpe_lib/}here}}
